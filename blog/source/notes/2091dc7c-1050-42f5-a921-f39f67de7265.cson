  Understanding the storages in an Android device, you can easily check or transfer files in both directions: your app and the device. For example, if your app have a licence file, and you want to check the permission, you can store licence file in Android device for further updating and changing.

  ### Storages in an Android Device
  
  To work with your deviceâ€™s file system, do the following:
  
  1. Open the device file browser by clicking __View > Tool Windows > Device File Explorer__.
  2. Select a device from the drop-down list.
  
  There two useful storages you can store your data:
  
  - one is the internal storage, which is located at: `data/data/app_name/`
  - another one is the external user storage, which is located at: `sdcard/`
  
  ### Examples for Creating files
  
  Here is a sample code that creates a file in the internal storage:
  
  ```java
   public void createFile() {
      try {
          File checkFile = new file(context.getApplicationInfo().dataDir + "/new_directory_name/");
          if(!checkFile.exists()) {
              checkFile.mkdir();
          }
          FileWriter file = new FileWriter(checkFile.getAbsolutePath() + "/filename");
          file.write("what you want to write in internal storage");
          file.flush();
          file.close();
      } catch(IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```
